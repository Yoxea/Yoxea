### Welcome to my profile, my name is Jonathan, I live in Israel and I enjoy editing, programming, learning history and about random facts

I have been playing video games since I was 3 years old (mainly strategy games) 
and I have been interested in tech since a young age

I speak English, Hebrew and Russian (still working on my cyrillic reading though)
